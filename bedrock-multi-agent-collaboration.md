# Amazon Bedrock Multi-Agent Collaboration

Based on [Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration: Building JARVIS (Smart Assistant) to solve complex problems with simple AI Agents](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/c68a2fb4-8b25-480f-ab0b-129778f96d4d/en-US)

> Amazon Bedrock Agents is a feature provided by Amazon Bedrock that enables you to build multi-step task automation by seamlessly connecting generative AI applications with your company systems, APIs, and data sources. Amazon Bedrock Agents use foundation model (FM) reasoning, APIs, and data to classify user requests, gather relevant information, and efficiently complete tasks, allowing teams to focus on high-value work. Building agents is simple and fast, requiring just a few steps to complete setup.
